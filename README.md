## Will all projects be developed with Lazarus?

The short answer is no. Although I'll use Lazarus for some projects and tasks, my main goal with this repository is to be able to develop and maintain console applications and libraries using Free Pascal.

## Why did this repository come to life?

Mainly because I work with Delphi and the IDE is not my cup of tea for coding. I use other editors like VSCode and Neovim for text editing, code navigation and small dfm file changes. I stick to Delphi for debugging and visual development. One day, I decided to try and make my life easier by developing a Language Server Client for Object Pascal. After some consideration, I decided to employ FPC for that task. This repository is the first step towards achieving that. Who knows, maybe it'll be helpful to the community as well.

## Project Structure

### "Forge" directory

- Everything you find in this directory was created and developed without the assistance of Lazarus.
